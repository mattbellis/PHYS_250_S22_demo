Jorts is a cat who got buttered. But that wasn't good. 

And Jeans is his sister. And now Jorts fights for labor
rights. 'Cos Jorts cares about the workers in this late-stage
of capitalism that we are in. 

Don't get me wrong, I am a free-market advocate, but I also
recognize that market forces sometimes need to be slowed
down a bit.
